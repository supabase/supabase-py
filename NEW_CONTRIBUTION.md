# Supabase Realtime Client Implementation

## Overview
This contribution implements a robust WebSocket-based realtime client for the Supabase Python library, enabling real-time data synchronization and event handling.

## Key Features

### 1. WebSocket Connection Management
- Secure WebSocket connection establishment with Supabase's realtime server
- Automatic connection handling with proper authentication
- Graceful connection termination

### 2. Channel Management
- Creation and management of realtime channels
- Support for channel subscriptions and unsubscriptions
- Topic-based message routing

### 3. Message Handling
- Implementation of `RealtimeMessage` class for structured message formatting
- Support for Phoenix WebSocket protocol
- Event-based message processing

### 4. Heartbeat Mechanism
- Reliable heartbeat system using threading
- Proper thread management with stop events
- Automatic reconnection handling

## Technical Implementation

### Core Classes

1. **RealtimeMessage**
   - Handles message formatting for WebSocket communication
   - Supports events, topics, and payloads
   - Provides JSON serialization

2. **RealtimeChannel**
   - Manages channel subscriptions
   - Handles topic-based message routing
   - Maintains listener callbacks

3. **RealtimeClient**
   - Manages WebSocket connections
   - Implements heartbeat mechanism
   - Handles channel creation and message routing

### Key Improvements
1. **Thread Safety**
   - Added `_stop_event` for proper thread termination
   - Improved thread management in heartbeat and listener threads
   - Safe connection state handling

2. **Error Handling**
   - Graceful error recovery in listener thread
   - Proper WebSocket connection error handling
   - Clean disconnection process

3. **Resource Management**
   - Proper cleanup of WebSocket connections
   - Thread cleanup on disconnection
   - Memory leak prevention

## Testing
The implementation includes comprehensive tests:
- Basic message handling
- Channel creation and management
- Client initialization
- Connection lifecycle
- Integration with Supabase realtime server

All tests are passing successfully, including:
- `test_realtime_message`
- `test_realtime_channel`
- `test_realtime_client_initialization`
- `test_realtime_channel_creation`
- `test_realtime_connection`

## Usage Example
```python
# Initialize the realtime client
client = RealtimeClient("wss://your-project.supabase.co/realtime/v1/websocket", "your-anon-key")

# Connect to the realtime server
client.connect()

# Create and subscribe to a channel
channel = client.channel("room:123")
channel.subscribe(lambda message: print(f"Received: {message}"))

# Disconnect when done
client.disconnect()
```

## Future Enhancements
1. Automatic reconnection strategy
2. Message queue for offline handling
3. Enhanced error reporting
4. Connection state callbacks
5. Channel presence support

This implementation provides a solid foundation for real-time features in the Supabase Python client, enabling developers to build responsive, real-time applications with ease.
