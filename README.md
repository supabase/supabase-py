## Recent Fixes

### ðŸ”§ GitHub Issue #1244 - Shared httpx Client URL Mutation (RESOLVED âœ…)

**Fixed**: Critical bug where shared `httpx.Client` instances caused URL corruption between Supabase services.

**Problem**: When using custom httpx clients, accessing multiple services (Storage, PostgREST, Functions) would mutate the shared client's `base_url`, causing API calls to hit wrong endpoints.

**Solution**: Implemented client isolation pattern that creates separate httpx clients for each service while preserving shared configuration (timeouts, SSL, proxy settings, etc.).

**Impact**: 
- âœ… All services maintain correct URLs
- âœ… No header duplication issues  
- âœ… Backward compatible - existing code works unchanged
- âœ… Custom httpx configuration preserved across all services

## Local Development

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/supabase/supabase-py.git
cd supabase-py
```

### Dependencies

This repository relies on the following dependencies for development: 
- `uv` for python project management.
- `make` for running project commands.
- `docker` for both `postgrest` and `auth` test containers.
- `supabase-cli` for both `storage` and `realtime` test containers.

All of these dependencies are included in the nix shell environment, through `flake.nix`. If you've got `nix` installed, you may prefer to use it through `nix develop`.

### Use a Virtual Environment

We recommend using a virtual environment, preferably through `uv`, given it is currently the only tool that understands the workspace setup (you can read more about it in [the uv docs](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/projects/workspaces/)).

```
uv venv supabase-py
source supabase-py/bin/activate
uv sync
```

If you're using nix, the generated `python` executable should have the correct dependencies installed for the whole workspace, given it is derived from the root's `pyproject.toml` using [uv2nix](https://github.com/pyproject-nix/uv2nix).

### Running tests and other commands

We use `make` to store and run the relevant commands. The structure is set up such that each sub package can individually set its command in its own `Makefile`, and the job of the main `Makefile` is just coordinate calling each of them.

For instance, in order to run all tests of all packages, you should use the following root command
```bash
make ci
```
Which internally dispatches `make -C src/{package} tests` calls to each package in the monorepo.

You should also consider using
```bash
make ci -jN # where N is the number of max concurrent jobs, or just -j for infinite jobs
```
To run each of the packages' tests in parallel. This should be generally faster than running in 1 job, but has the downside of messing up the CLI output, so parsing error messages might not be easy.

Other relevant commands include
```bash
make install-hooks # install all commit hooks into the local .git folder
make stop-infra    # stops all running containers from all packages
make clean         # delete all intermediary files created by testing
```
All the subpackages command are available from the main root by prefixing the command with `{package_name}.`. Examples:
```bash
make realtime.tests # run only realtime tests
make storage.clean  # delete temporary files only in the storage package
```
