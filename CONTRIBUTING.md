## Create a pull request

When making pull requests to the repository, make sure to follow these guidelines for both bug fixes and new features:

- Before creating a pull request, file a GitHub Issue so that maintainers and the community can discuss the problem and potential solutions before you spend time on an implementation.
- In your PR's description, link to any related issues or pull requests to give reviewers the full context of your change.
- For commit messages, follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) format.
  - For example, if you update documentation for a specific extension, your commit message might be: `docs(extension-name) updated installation documentation`.
